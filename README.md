# Power-BI_Sales-Analysis
Regular excel is so slow for lots of functions, it requires a lot of manual steps to make some detailed analysis. However, Power Query, which is embedded into Power BI helps us to make faster, more complex, memory friendly calculations. We are diving deep on Power BI and creating lots of new calculations that would run as a connection and would not increase the file size. 

The calculations includes:
Creating moving average
, Creating conditional summing
, Data visualising 
, Historical data comperison based on previous year and more.
